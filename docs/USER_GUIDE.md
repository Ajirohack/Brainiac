## 🎯 Basic Usage

### Simple Queries

#### Chat Interface
```
User: What are the implications of quantum computing on cybersecurity?

CAI: Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift that will significantly impact cybersecurity. The most immediate concern is that quantum computers could break widely-used encryption algorithms like RSA and ECC through Shor's algorithm, which can efficiently factor large numbers.

Key implications include:

1. **Encryption Vulnerability**: Current public-key cryptography will become vulnerable, requiring transition to quantum-resistant algorithms.

2. **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Development of new cryptographic methods that can withstand quantum attacks is already underway.

3. **Data Harvesting Concerns**: Sensitive data encrypted today could be stored by adversaries and decrypted later when quantum computers become more powerful.

4. **Quantum Key Distribution**: Quantum mechanics principles can create theoretically unhackable communication channels.

5. **Authentication Challenges**: Digital signatures and identity verification systems will need redesigning.

Organizations should begin quantum risk assessments and develop migration strategies to quantum-resistant cryptography.
```

#### API Request

**Do:**
- Be specific and clear in your requests
- Provide relevant context
- Break complex questions into manageable parts
- Specify the desired output format

**Don't:**
- Use vague or ambiguous language
- Ask multiple unrelated questions in one query
- Provide excessive irrelevant information

**Examples:**

❌ **Poor Query**: "Tell me about energy."

✅ **Improved Query**: "Provide a comparison of solar and wind energy technologies, focusing on efficiency, cost, and environmental impact for residential applications in coastal regions."

### Performance Optimization

#### Efficient Processing

1. **Choose the Right Mode**:
   - Use cognitive-only mode for simple questions
   - Use hybrid mode for knowledge-intensive tasks
   - Reserve full collaboration for truly complex problems

2. **Optimize Context**:
   - Include only relevant context
   - Clear conversation history when starting new topics
   - Use structured context for better results

3. **Batch Processing**:
   - Group related queries into batch jobs
   - Schedule batch processing during off-peak hours
   - Use webhooks for notification when complete
